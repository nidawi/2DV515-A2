## Assignment Checklist
### E
1. ~~Implement K-means Clustering with Pearson similarity~~
2. ~~Run the algorithm on the blog data dataset with 5 clusters~~
3. ~~The iteration shall stop after a specified number of iterations~~
4. ~~Present the result as a list of clusters and their assignments~~
5. Implement the system using a REST web service where:
5.1. client sends a request to a server
5.2. the server responds with json data
5.3. the json data is decoded and presented in a client GUI
### C-D
1. ~~Instead of stopping after a specified number of iterations, you shall implement functionality for stopping when no new assignments are made~~
2. ~~Each cluster must keep track of the previous assignment, and a check is made if the new cluster assignment matches the previous one~~
### A-B
1. Implement Hierarchical Clustering with Pearson similarity
2. Run the algorithm on the blog data dataset
3. Present the result as an interactive tree in the client GUI (it shall be possible to expand/collapse branches)
### GUI Appearance & Execution Examples
> Note: While I am no designer by any means, this GUI could have been made prettier with more time. You said that appearance does not matter, and this fulfils all functional requirements so I deem it as "good enough", but no more than that.
